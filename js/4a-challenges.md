## 4a. Challenges

**1. Count the letter**

In the for loop below, how many instances of “a” will there be in aLotOfAs? Hint: aLotOfAs.length tells you how many characters are in the string aLotOfAs.

```
let aLotOfAs = "";

for (var i = 0; aLotOfAs.length < 10; i++) {
	aLotOfAs += "a";
}
```

**2. Adding Numbers**

Using repetition, write a program that prompts the user for five numbers and computes the totl of the numbers.

Example Output.
```
Enter a number: 1
Enter a number: 2
Enter a number: 3
Enter a number: 4
Enter a number: 5
The total is 15.
```

**3. Multiplication Table**

Create a program that generates multiplication tables for the numbers 0 through 12.
Example Output. Use a nested loop.
```
0 x 0 = 0
0 x 1 = 0
...
12 x 11 = 132
12 x 12 = 144
```
